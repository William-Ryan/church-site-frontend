                    We believe in the verbal inspiration of the 66 books of the Bible in its original writings and that it is without error and is the sole authority in all matters of faith and practice.
                </Typography>
                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe there is only one true God, existing in three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. These three are co-eternal and co-equal from all eternity, each with distinct personalities but of one essence.
                </Typography>
                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe that Adam was created without sin but fell by disobedience and thus the whole race fell and is by nature spiritually dead and lost.
                </Typography>
                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, co-existent with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and that He came to the world born of a virgin, shed His blood on Calvary as a vicarious substitute for all sin, that He was buried and rose again bodily and ascended to the right hand of the Father.

                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe in the Person and work of the Holy Spirit which includes conviction of sin, regeneration of sinners, indwelling of believers, and sealing the redeemed. We Believe the gifts of the Holy Spirit are for soul-winning and building the local church.
                </Typography>
                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe a soul is saved when sin is repented of and when Christ is accepted as personal Savior and Lord and the Holy Spirit imparts eternal life.

                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe that it is the plan of God for each believer to walk after the Spirit and not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe in the Triune immersion of the believer in water to signify His death by His purpose and knowledge and spread of the Word including worldwide missions. We believe that it is completely self-determining and responsible only to Christ, the Head of the church. We believe it to be completely independent with no other person, group, or body having any authority, right or intervention, or control in any form whatsoever over or within a local church.
                </Typography>
                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe that soul-winning and worldwide evangelization is the oriority of each local church.

                <Typography style={{ textIndent: "2%", margin: "1% 0%", fontSize: "1.4rem" }}>
                    We believe Baptism, feetwashing and Communion, anointing with oil and laying of hands constitutes the ordinances of the Church.
